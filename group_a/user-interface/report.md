# How can the user interface (UI) be optimized for an intuitive and enjoyable customization experience?

**Data and analysis:**
We aim to minimize friction, providing clear interaction points, and supporting creativity.

Several key metrics can be employed to evaluate customer satisfaction for UI optimisation. They are:

1. **Task Completion Rate** (% of users who completed the customization)
2. **Click Heatmaps** (Where users are interacting the most)
3. **Conversion Rate** (% of users who order the product after customization)
4. **Time on Task** (time spent on customization)
5. **Customer Satisfaction (CSAT)** (0 -100 Rating)
6. **After-Scenario Questionnaire (ASQ)** (3 Questions Survey)

These metrics can generally be classified into 2 data collection methods, i.e. **Website Analytics** (1-4) and **Surveys** (5&6).

**Key insight:**
Use A/B testing to decide on design choices. Higher frequency interaction and task completion rate generally corresponds to user preference. We can also conduct unmoderated User Testing to collect website analytics data and volunteer questionnaire for manual review.

Users prefer a familiar, conversational flow paired with clear visuals. Features like natural language prompts, a color picker, image upload, and transparent pricing—combined with examples and real-time previews—create a smooth and engaging customization journey.

As such, an UI draft is created ready for further testing.

**Business Impact:**
A clean, guided UI improves satisfaction, encourages engagement, and boosts conversions. It also provide an efficient user feedback portal and systematic data collection method to develop a user-centric interface. This would create a sustainable business model that adapts to the general public preference.
