# What are the potential challenges in implementing a real-time AI-powered customization platform?

**Data and analysis:** We analyzed user behaviors and failure points in similar tools involving AI prompts and image uploads. Key issues include inappropriate or copyrighted user inputs, IP protection for user-generated content, system abuse through repeated requests, and mismatch between AI output and user expectations. User satisfaction drops when outputs don’t align with intent or when users feel their designs aren’t safely handled.

**Key insight:** The major challenges are: (1) prompt and image moderation, (2) copyright/IP concerns—both protecting users’ original designs and avoiding third-party IP violations, (3) system abuse that could strain server performance, and (4) ensuring user satisfaction with AI interpretations. Proactive checks, user declarations, rate limiting, and design lifecycle policies are essential.

**Business impact:** A well-handled customization interface will boost engagement, reduce drop-offs, and improve conversion rates for custom products.
