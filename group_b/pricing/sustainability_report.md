### Q4: How can we ensure the sustainability of our inventory and pricing models?

For the pricing model, we can factor in the cost of eco-friendly materials and sustainable production methods when
adjusting the base price and consider a sustainability adjustment, which incorporates price incentives for sustainable
products. Additionally, demand adjustments can also capture consumption patterns for sustainable goods, allowing the
model to reward sustainable goods and penalize unsustainable ones. With this sustainability adjustment, consumers are
encouraged to buy greener products. Over time, as demand for sustainable goods grows, economics of scale drive down
prices further, creating a positive feedback loop that enhances affordability and adoption. This highlights the critical
role of pricing in influencing consumer behavior toward sustainability.

To complement this adjustment, businesses can offer incentives like loyalty programs to encourage sustainable consumer
purchases. Points can be earned when consumers purchase sustainable goods and then redeemed for vouchers or extra
customisation perks like name embroidery, which can be particularly attractive for our context on customizable products.
These incentives can then further boost demand for sustainable products, allowing the pricing model to capture
sustainable patterns and reinforce sustainable trends.
