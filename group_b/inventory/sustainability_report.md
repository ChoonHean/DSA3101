### Q4: How can we ensure the sustainability of our inventory and pricing models?

Throughout an e-commerce product's lifecycle, various stages contribute to its environmental footprintâ€”from manufacturing to consumer delivery. Key stages with significant environmental effects include manufacturing, transportation, and inventory management. By incorporating sustainability considerations into inventory and pricing models, businesses can mitigate these impacts.  

Key environmental factors such as carbon emissions from production, transportation, warehouse storage, and waste disposal can be quantified as external costs. These costs are introduced as penalties that adjust key variables like lead time, order cost and holding cost, which can greatly influence the Reorder Point (ROP) and Economic Order Quantity (EOQ), ensuring that inventory decisions account for environmental sustainability.
For instance, high transportation emissions can increase order costs due to the environmental penalties, leading to a higher Economic Order Quantity (EOQ). A higher EOQ suggests that a bulk order should be made, thereby helping to reduce the shipment frequencies and promote greener logistics. Therefore, businesses can use these insights to refine their purchasing strategies, supplier selection, and transportation methods.
