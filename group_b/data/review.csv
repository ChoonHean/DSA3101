5,B00LOPVX74,2020,1,"Pretty locket I think this locket is really pretty. The inside back is a solid silver depression and the front is a dome that is not solid (knotted). You could use it to store a small photo, lock of hair, etc but I use it when I need to carry medication with me. Closes securely. High quality & very pretty.",4.7
